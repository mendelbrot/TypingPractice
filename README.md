# Typing Practice

This is a WPF project for a desktop application. This is an application that allows users to practice typing text and it shows the text on the screen unedited with line breaks, so that the user can read, learn, and enjoy the text as they are typing. 

This is great for practice typing poetry, stories, articles, or PowerShell scripts. I created this because other typing apps I've tried remove line breaks, which ruins the enjoyment of poems and other texts.

These are the features:

1. For the practice material it uses a user provided text file.
2. The view is a copy of the text file, including punctuation and line breaks.
3. There is a cursor that moves as the user types.
4. The view scrolls as the user goes to the next line to keep the line with the cursor vertically centered in the view.
5. If the user makes a mistake, it will play a sound.
6. It will not let the user continue typing unless they type the correct letter.
7. It will calculate and display the users typing speed and accuracy.
